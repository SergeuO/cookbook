# assuming that there is 512-byte DOS-like MBR/MBS on /dev/sda
# (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_boot_record)


# backup MBR from disk to file:
dd if=/dev/sda of=./mbr-backup.bin bs=512 count=1

# restore MBR from file to disk:
dd if=./mbr-backup.bin of=/dev/sda bs=512 count=1

# delete MBR from disk:
dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sda bs=512 count=1

# NOTE: some BSD-like systems would resist your attempts to shoot in the foot.
